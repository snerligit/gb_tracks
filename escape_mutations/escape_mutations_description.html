<h2>Description</h2>
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes play an important role in protecting hosts against pathogens. Infact, they directly kill cells infected with viruses by examining MHC class I molecules that carry viral epitopes to the surface of the cell. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, infected patients have elicited CTL responses by showing higher levels of granzyme B, perforin and IFN-gamma.

Rapid rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 may hinder the presentation of peptides by MHC-I molecules thereby evading T cell response. The work that we reference here (found in the reference section) has performed deep sequencing of viral genomes from several patients and identified mutations that were observed in Nucleocapsid (N), ORF1ab, Membrane (M), and  Envelope (E) proteins. This track includes 194 mutants spanning 305 T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*40:01.

<h2>Methods</h2>
In this study, deep sequencing was performed on virus samples from Austria. To identify mutant epitopes, MHC-I binding assays were performed. Subsequently, PBMCs collected from HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*40:01 typed, COVID-19 patients were subjected to functional assays. A more detailed description of the methodoly is decribed in the original article provided in the Reference section.
